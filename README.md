but what happen when you entangle the two with head-on collision?

The merging of all moons in the solar system into a single entity or event could be creatively named based on various themes like mythology, astronomy, or scientific terminology. Here are some ideas:

### **Mythological Names**
1. **Lunasis**  
   - Derived from "Luna" (Latin for the Moon) and "Genesis" (beginning/creation). Suggests the birth of a unified celestial body.

2. **Seleneon**  
   - Combining "Selene" (Greek goddess of the Moon) with "aeon" (eternity). Suggests a grand, eternal unification.

3. **Titanforge**  
   - Drawing from "Titan" (the largest moon of Saturn and mythological giants) and "forge" (symbolizing fusion and creation).

### **Scientific or Cosmic Names**
4. **Moonglomeration**  
   - A combination of "moon" and "conglomeration," representing the aggregation of all moons.

5. **Lunifusion**  
   - Fusion of all lunar bodies into one.

6. **Unified Satellite Body (USB)**  
   - A scientific and neutral term describing a single body formed from all moons.

---

### **Astrophysical Names**
7. **Orbital Collapse Event (OCE)**  
   - Highlighting the astrophysical process where all moons collapse into one massive body.

8. **Selenial Synthesis**  
   - Combining "selenology" (study of the Moon) and "synthesis" (combination).

9. **Moonmerge**  
   - A simple, descriptive term that resonates with modern naming conventions.

### **Poetic Names**
10. **The Lunar Union**  
    - A poetic and elegant way to describe the merging of all moons.

11. **Eclipse Eternal**  
    - Suggesting a permanent celestial event, reminiscent of an eternal eclipse.

12. **Heaven's Convergence**  
    - Evoking a sense of cosmic harmony and grandeur.

---

### **Fictional or Sci-Fi Names**
13. **Solaryte**  
    - A futuristic name indicating a single moon that belongs to the entire solar system.

14. **Orbimonolith**  
    - Suggesting a giant monolithic body formed from all moons.

15. **Selensphere**  
    - Combining "Selene" with "sphere," indicating the spherical nature of the merged moons.

---

### **Choice Explanation**
- If you want a poetic and mythological feel, **Lunasis** or **The Lunar Union** might work best.
- If you prefer a scientific or straightforward term, **Unified Satellite Body (USB)** or **Lunifusion** could be apt.
- For a sci-fi twist, **Orbimonolith** or **Solaryte** are compelling.
